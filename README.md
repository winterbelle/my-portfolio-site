# Welcome to my Portfolio!
Hello there! My name is Blanca Altamirano 💁🏼‍♀️ but you can call me Belle 🌸. This repository contains the code that created my portfolio website. On this site, you will learn a little bit about who I am and how I got started in tech. You will be able to view projects that I've worked on as well as be able to view my resume. Feel free to reach out to me via email 📧 at blanca.altamirano0318@gmail.com.
